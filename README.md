The project focus is in describing the uncertainty within population expected return of a portfolio containing stock(s).


The portfolio is modeled as a multivariate normal distribution, however the univariate case is also explored, requiring different methods of statistical analysis to
approximate the confidence regions of expected return. The variance is also explored as this gives insight into how portfolio volatility is affected.
